\section{Overview}

This section includes some tricks extracted from my years' experience of using \LaTeX{}.
Rule of thumb: Doing the right things in the right way can your efforts. 
And I am just the right person telling you this. 

\subsection{Citing, Referring and Hyperlinks}

A book~\cite{BOOK:Gray} is cited.

\begin{figure}[!t]

  \caption{A collection of food.}
  \label{intro:fig:vege}
\end{figure}

An online article~\cite{tpc-c} is cited. \citet{tods92:Mohan} created a new area.

\autoref{intro:fig:vege} demonstrates a collection of vegetables. 
There are broccoli, carrot, pea, onion, snow bean, scallion, etc.
They are healthy food characteristic of high-fiber and low-calorie. 

\begin{align}
  Q_{a}^{b} &= \sum_{x=1}^{\infty} \dfrac{\prod_{y=1}^{x} f(y) - a}{\lim_{z \to x} g(z) + b} + 
               \int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx \label{eq:sample:1}\\
            &= H_{1}(a, b) + H_{2}(a, b) \nonumber\\
            &= \gamma(a, b) \label{eq:sample:2}
\end{align}

\autoref{eq:sample:1}, albeit complex, is equivalent to \autoref{eq:sample:2}.
Note that we do not label the second line of the derivation process.
Given $f(x) = x^{2}$ and $0 < x \leq 1$, we have
\[
  f(1) = 1^{2} = 1
\]
and the result is quite simple. 

You may go to \href{https://github.com/streamjoin/nusthesis}{my GitHub repository} by searching for ``nus latex template'' in Google or accessing the url  \url{https://github.com/streamjoin/nusthesis} directly. 

You may refer to the \href{run:./src/references.bib}{bibliography file} to see its organization.  

\subsection{Hyphenation}

The compound word ``ingredient\zz{}insensitive'', where the hyphen is generated through command \CMD{\zz{}} will be hyphenated for individual words rather than the compound word as a whole. 
In contrast, ``nutrition-oriented'' with normal hyphen will be hyphenated as a whole compound word, which is unlikely to be recognized by \LaTeX\ and therefore no hyphenation will be carried out unless you provide customized hyphenation for it. 

\section{Thesis Synopsis}

The rest of this thesis is organized as follows. 
In \autoref{ch:review}, we conduct a literature review. 
\autoref{ch:rice} provides the study on rice. 
\autoref{ch:noodle} describes noodles. 
We conclude the entire thesis as well as discuss further directions for future research in \autoref{ch:concl}.
